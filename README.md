# CS210_Programming_Languages - Airgead Banking App

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Airgead banking app was developed for use by high school students to teach them the importance of saving money. The student inputs values for the initial deposit, recurring deposit amount, interest rate, and length of time in years. The output shows them what they would earn in interest over time with no future deposits as well as with monthly deposits thereby reinforcing the power of saving.

What did you do particularly well?
Simplifying the main class was one area in which I excelled. I utilized simple comments explaining functions, architecture and reasoning. Test code was left built within the classes to support future revision testing and debugging.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I set the columns to specific widths within the code and offset to the millions for dollar amounts. I would like to improve this code to recognize the length of the values and automatically adjust column width to fit each value. This would make it less likely to throw a runtime error when the calculations are excessively large values.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think that the most challenging part of writing this code was understanding how to pass parameters by reference and why it is necessary to do so.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I found that exception handling is a particularly useful type of code. It interested me in that I had to be really creative for some types of runtime errors. I also feel that displaying information in a tabular format is useful for many types of applications. Though this project was relatively simplistic, I was able to build a foundation of coding techniques that really enhanced my skillset.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used a lot of comments to explain my approach. Spacing and alignment help to outline separation between each function. I developed test code for sections where I needed to test the output before aggregating it. I left that code within the original code for ease of future testing and maintenance. I also included error handling which is so important. You always need to test in order to break your work. Identifying the "corner" case is important to allow the program to end gracefully without crashing.
